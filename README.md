# RenderingSImulator

A simple rendering simulator that simulates the rendering techniques used to optimise graphics. Includes frustum Culling, sprite Batching, and Anti-Aliasing
Along with this. There is also an output panel which continously displays the amount of resources being used. This is very handy, because it demonstrates the actual optimizating being done. 

I actually made this project for a technical competition, where I spoke about graphics rendering, and used this as a model. Uses Java 21 and flatLaf libraries for LAF. All rendering is done via the default Java graphics library (Graphics2D for the win)
